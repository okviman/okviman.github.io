## About me

I am a PhD student working in the [Lagergren Lab](https://lagergrenlab.org/). My research interests are in Bayesian phylogenetics and probabilistic machine learning in general. From a machine learning perspective, my recent and current works involveÂ variational inference, variational auto-encoders, sequential Monte Carlo methods and Monte Carlo objective functions. In phylogenetics, I research variational inference-based phylogenetics, tree sampling methods (including Bayesian alternatives to bootstrap NJ) and inference of Gene/Species trees.
